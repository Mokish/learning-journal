### mindset in my own word.
- you should have an exact schedule to stading and doing your homework,
- you should go trough your licture every day after the class,
- you should talk to your classments and ask them questions and ask your TA or teachers.

* growth mindset is the role that you make to have a better way of learning. as i believe i had a good growth mindset that i have learned a lot of things by myself. that is growth mindset.
